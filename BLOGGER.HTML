            <p class="text-success"><b>Self-confidence is the internal belief in your abilities, worth, and judgment,

            <br><br><dl>
                <dt>1)  Stop Comparing Yourself: <p class="text-success">Comparing your journey to others is a direct route to low self-esteem.
                     Focus solely on your own progress and path.</p></dt>
                <dt>2) Embrace "Small" Successes: <p class="text-success"> Keep a "win list" of personal achievements, no matter how minor they seem.
                     This reinforces a sense of accomplishment and competence.</p></dt> 
                <dt> 3) Step Out of Your Comfort Zone: <p class="text-success"> Growth happens when you say "yes" to intimidating
                     opportunities (like speaking up or starting a new project). Doing so proves to yourself that you are capable of handling challenges.</p></dt> 
                <dt>4) Reframe Failure as Growth: <p class="text-success"> Rejection and failure are not permanent, but necessary, parts of life. They are feedback, not final judgments on your worth.</p></dt>
                <dt>5) Curate Your Circle:<p class="text-success"> Surround yourself with positive, supportive people who uplift you, and limit time with those who bring you down. </p></dt>

            <dt>1) Watch Your Self-Talk:<p class="text-success"><b> Challenge the inner critic that tells you that you cannot do something. Reframe, "I'm not good at this," to, "I'm not good at this yet".</b></p></dt>
            <dt>2) Practice Self-Care: <p class="text-success"><b>Your physical, mental, and emotional health impacts your confidence. When you feel good, you feel more capable.</b></p></dt>
            <dt>3) Take Action First:<p class="text-success"><b> Don't wait for confidence to appear before you act. Take the action first, and confidence will follow as a result of your experience. </b></p></dt>
